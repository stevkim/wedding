## About
<a id='about'></a>
<p>
  A wedding site used as an itinerary @ our wedding on July 9, 2023 that served a guest list of 100 people. The wedding was held @ <a href='https://www.thejardindelsol.com/'>Jardin del Sol</a>.
  The project was developed to be used on mobile, then later optimized for web capabilities.

## Takeaways
<a id='takeaways'></a>
<p>
  This project used React's Context hook as state management. The learning to manage state in a slightly more complicated architecture introduced ways to prevent prop-drilling. This project also introduced me to Redux, which I ended up using for later projects.
</p>
<p>
  Framer motion was used for animations. Specifically the useInView hook that allowed me to animate component renders when coming into the viewport of the user. This, in combination with Tailwind css, is allows for fluid transitions.
</p>
<p>
  Another issue i ran into was the sheer size of images. Although they were held locally, they were fairly big in size. I ended up using an <a href='https://tinypng.com/'>online service</a> to compress the images for faster loading times.
