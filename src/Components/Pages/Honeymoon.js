                <p>We know it's traditional to write a list,</p>
                <p>But in this case there is a slight twist,</p>
                <p>Our home is complete with the usual stuff,</p>
                <p>And the things that we have are good enough.</p>
                <p>Our dream is to honeymoon in a foreign land,</p>
                <p>And walk along the beach hand in hand.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>We hope you don't think of us as being rude,</p>
                <p>And that our request is not misconstrued.</p>
                <p>But a contribution to our honeymoon pot,</p>
                <p>Would be appreciated such a lot.</p>
                <p>But the most important thing to say.</p>
                <p>Is that you are there to celebrate our day!</p>
